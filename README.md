## Problem Motivation
* University is often one of the most valuable place for both students and the stuffs here. Wetry to connect with others and exchange precious resources in this place. However, as our social network expands, it becomes increasingly hard to manage such large network. After many hours of study and working, our human brain is unlikely to keep track of every detail of the events had and people met. Moreover, the diverse social media channels also make communcation less direct and effective. Usually, we use handwritten contact book to record information of our friends. Yet it is pretty tedious and tiresome. Thus, it would be great if we can conveniently maintain healthy relationship online and even find new opportunities and resources through the relationship we build.

## Aim 
* To develop a web application that helps people create, manage and safely store important details about the people they want to keep connected with in their ever-expanding social circle.
